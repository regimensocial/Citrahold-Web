        what is Citrahold?
    </div>

    <p>
        Simply put, Citrahold provides you with everything you need to easily <b>move game saves from a physical 3DS to
            a 3DS emulator</b> on your computer (and vice versa).
    </p>

    <p>
        This sounds like a niche issue, but this solves a major issue for me. I quite enjoy emulating Pokemon at high
        resolutions, but I still want to play it on the train.
    </p>

    <p>
        I would like to keep my saves though, and be able to move them back and forth. Kind of like a poor man's Switch
        (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Citra/comments/9kcgrx/syncing_saves_between_citra_and_3ds_poor_mans/">as
            someone else has put it</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
        And thus, <b>Citrahold</b> was created (Citra being the name of the main emulator, -hold because you physically
        hold your saves within the 3DS).
    </p>
    <p>
        A save manager (Checkpoint) is still required, but this massively speeds things up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Citrahold exists as <b>three</b>:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Citrahold 3DS (a 3DS Homebrew application, available as a .cia or .3dsx)
        </li>
        <li>
            Citrahold PC (an executable program, for Windows, Mac, and Linux)
        </li>
        <li>
            Citrahold Web (this very platform)
        </li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <p>
        <i>
            And also Citrahold Server... But if you're here, you likely don't need to worry about that.
