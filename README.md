# Citrahold-Web
Citrahold-Web is the front-end for [Citrahold Server](https://github.com/regimensocial/Citrahold-Server).

It's not written with any proper framework because I just wanted to make a (fairly) clean static website.

I say this, but I am considering remaking it in Svelte... But we'll see...

**If you are planning on just using Citrahold, you can ignore this repo. You just need [Citrahold-3DS](https://github.com/regimensocial/Citrahold-3DS) and [Citrahold-PC](https://github.com/regimensocial/citraholdUI/)!**

Proper README coming soon!
